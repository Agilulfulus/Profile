		<h1>NALLANTLI</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to my personal profile page. There's not all that much to see around here, but you are welcome to
			take a look around.
			You'll find here a nice brief overview of my work and interests, and perhaps something interesting to carry
			back home.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a Linguistics Major at the University of Florida, and will be graduating at the end of this year
			(2020).
			Despite majoring in Linguistics, I have a long and fortunate history with programming and Computer Science,
			which
			I continue to act in as a hobby along with my linguistics studies. In certain cases, the worlds do collide,
			but
			for the most part unless something calls for computational linguistics specifically they remain separate.

		<h1>NAME</h1>
		<p>
			My real name is Benjamin R. Park, but on the internet I have taken up the username <b>Nallantli</b> [<span
				class="IPA">ˈnaːl.lãːn.tɬi</span>] (or, Anglicized
			as [<span class="IPA">nəˈlãnt.li</span>], or [<span class="IPA">nəˈlãn.(t)ʃi</span>]), a calque of the
			Nahuatl
			postpositions <b>nâl + tlân</b>, meaning "to the other side" and "from; at" respectively, plus the
			additional <b>tli</b>
			nominalizer so that my name is indeed a regular noun. The meaning roughly translates to "(he/it) is from the
			other side (of something)."
			I like to consider this pseudonym to be a reflection of my two contrasting interests, the social aspects of
			learning and studying languages
			and the analytics of Linguistics and Computer Science. Additionally, I just think it sounds cool.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many people who have spoken to me for an extended period of time on the internet (approximately two years ago I made the switch) 
			refer to me as <b>Aggy</b>, an abbreviation of my former username <b>Agilulfulus</b>, taken as a dimunitive form of Italo Calvino's 
			eponymous character Agilulf from the novel <b>The Nonexistent Knight</b>.
